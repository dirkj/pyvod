Python based visual occupancy detector

The goal of this project is to create a visual observation
tool for model railway stations, to detect the occupancy
status of tracks. It is meant to be generic as a means of
being able to be applied to different kind of stations.
A schematic station track layout plan is used to visualize
the occupancy status. Therefore, the software needs to
detect the station plan and map it against the schema
based track layout.

Status: Experimental
